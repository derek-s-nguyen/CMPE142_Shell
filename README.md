# CMPE142_Shell
**By:** Gabriele Roque, Derek Nguyen, and Tiffany Nguyen

For our first assignment, we were supposed to create a shell where we will learn how to implement basic commands using a Linux environment.

**How to build our shell:**
Get input from user, parse through line extracting tokens, and check if commands are built-in commands. If commands are built-in, run our implementation; if not, use execv with the specified path.

**Our shell name:** Forknife
